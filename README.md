# Data-Science-Scrapbook
This is where I train my Python skills for Data Science.
The "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" contains the projects made while taking the following course on Udemy: "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/"

The programs themselves are coded in Jupyter notebooks as it offers more visibility to what is being done. With each program there is an associated HTML file which contains the content of the notebook.
